## Projects

### Project 1 - [E-commerce Startup Sales Forecast Model Assessment](https://github.com/kulwinderkk/Sales-forecast-for-Brazilian-ecommerce-startup-olist)

>**Overview**: Spearheaded the development of a sophisticated E-commerce sales forecast model, harnessing cutting-edge time-series techniques such as SARIMAX, FB Prophet, XGBoost, and LSTM neural networks. To empower our stakeholders with actionable insights, I meticulously visualized the model's findings through dynamic Tableau dashboards.

### Project 2 - [NLP Based Recipe Recommendation System ](https://github.com/kulwinderkk/recipe_recommender_nlp)

>**Overview**: Utilized advanced content-based filtering with cosine similarity for recipe recommendations to suggest most similar recipes based on user input preference be it recipe name or ingredients. Built it on [Recipe Box](https://eightportions.com/datasets/Recipes/), which contains ~125K scraped recipes.

### Project 3 - [Empowering Change through Data Analysis, Dash, and Interactive Charts](https://github.com/kulwinderkk/data-analysis-mass-shooting-us-plotly-dash)

>**Overview**: Embarked on a transformative journey with a mission to make a difference. My focus: U.S. mass shooting data. Armed with analytical tools and unwavering resolve, I explored this critical issue, unearthing insights that could spark change. Didn't stop at analysis; I also built a dynamic Dash application enriched with interactive Plotly charts.

### Project 4 - [Big Data Wrangling with Google Books Ngrams](https://github.com/kulwinderkk/Big_data_Wrangling_GoogleNgram_data_analysis)

>**Overview**: In this project, I applied the skills to analyze a vast real-world dataset. The dataset, Google Ngrams, represents a substantial portion of digitized books throughout history, hosted on Amazon S3. My workflow involved setting up an EMR cluster with Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Jupyterhub, and Livy. I loaded, filtered, and visualized the data, which was stored in CSV format on S3. Using PySpark, I performed data exploration, filtering, and analysis, including plotting token occurrences over time. Additionally, I compared Hadoop and Spark as distributed file systems, highlighting their key advantages and differences.

### Project 5 - Hotel Review Sentiment Analysis

>**Overview**: Utilized NLP to preprocess the hotel review text data, did data wrangling and feature engineering. Employed different machine learning algorithms such as KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree to predict the likelihood of rating. Evaluated the model predictions using appropriate evaluation metrics and visualized the confusion matrix.
